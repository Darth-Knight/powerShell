# **Follow the Following Steps**

There are 2 files in this repo 
1. **Cursor.ps1**  - This is for moving the cursor
2. **Keyboard.ps**  - This is for pressing a key on the keyboard

### **1. Moving Cursor**


- Open the file cursor.ps1
- Download the file by clicking on this link [here](https://github.com/Darth-Knight/powerShell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- This will download a zip file for you extract the file. 
- Extract the files in any of the Local drives other than **C: drive**

**How to run the file** 

Execute the following commands in this order
- Copy the files in D: drive
- Open Powershell from the task bar - It will open a black/blue coloured terminal
- Type the following commands 
- ```cd D:```
  
- ```powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File cursor.ps1```


To stop the cursor. Kill the blue terminal (Close the window by clicking on the X on top right)
Hopefully chal jana chahiye ab is point pr. Nhi chle to screenshots share krne pdenge :D

**P.S.** There is a cursor.exe file as well If you run it there won't be no need to fire any of these commands.
If you use it the cursor will keep moving for an hour. I am still working on how to stop the cursor from moving if we use cursor.exe file
